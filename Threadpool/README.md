# Python Threading Tutorial

## Overview

This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to multithreading in Python using the `threading` module and related tools. It covers everything from basic threading concepts to advanced thread patterns and thread pools.

## Structure

The tutorial is organized into standalone modules that each focus on a specific threading concept:

1. **Introduction to Threading** - Basic concepts and the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
2. **Basic Threading** - Creating and running simple threads
3. **Thread Subclassing** - Creating custom thread classes
4. **Daemon Threads** - Working with background threads
5. **Thread Synchronization**
   - Locks - Preventing race conditions
   - RLock - Using reentrant locks
   - Event - Signaling between threads
   - Condition - Complex coordination between threads
   - Semaphore - Limiting concurrent access
   - Barrier - Synchronizing multiple threads
6. **Thread-Safe Queue** - Thread-safe data exchange
7. **Thread Local** - Thread-specific data storage
8. **Timer Threads** - Delayed execution
9. **ThreadPoolExecutor** - Built-in thread pool implementation
10. **Custom Thread Pool** - Creating your own thread pool from scratch

## How to Use This Tutorial

### Running the Tutorial

You can run the tutorial by executing the main.py file:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will present you with options to run specific examples or all examples. Each module is independent and can be run separately.

### Learning Path

1. Start with the introduction to understand threading concepts and limitations
2. Work through the basic threading examples to learn how to create and manage threads
3. Explore thread synchronization to learn how to coordinate between threads
4. Study the more advanced topics like thread pools and thread-local storage

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- The only external dependency is `requests`, used in the web crawler example

## Key Concepts Covered

- Thread creation and lifecycle
- Thread synchronization and coordination
- Thread-safe data structures
- Thread pools and work queues
- Common threading patterns
- Best practices for threading in Python
- Thread safety and race conditions
- GIL limitations and considerations

## Real-World Applications

This tutorial includes practical examples of common threading use cases:

- Web crawler using multiple threads
- Connection pool with semaphores
- Work queue with producer-consumer pattern
- Thread-local database connections
- Custom thread pool implementation
- Parallel execution of tasks

## Notes

- Remember that Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) prevents true parallel execution of Python code in a single process
- Threading is best suited for I/O-bound tasks rather than CPU-bound tasks
- For CPU-bound workloads, consider using the `multiprocessing` module instead
