# Process Pool Tutorial

Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on Process Pools in Python! This tutorial is designed to help you understand how to use multiple processes to speed up your Python programs.

## What Are Process Pools?

Process pools allow you to run multiple functions at the same time using separate CPU cores. This is great for tasks that:
- Are CPU-intensive
- Don't depend on each other
- Can run independently

## Why Use Process Pools?

- **Speed**: Run tasks in parallel instead of one after another
- **Resource Usage**: Make full use of all CPU cores
- **Simplicity**: Easier than managing processes manually

## Tutorial Structure

This tutorial includes the following files:

1. `01_process_basics.py` - Introduction to processes in Python
2. `02_process_pool_basics.py` - Basic usage of ProcessPoolExecutor
3. `03_map_and_submit.py` - Different ways to run tasks (map vs submit)
4. `04_error_handling.py` - Handling errors in process pools
5. `05_shared_resources.py` - Working with shared data between processes
6. `06_process_communication.py` - Communication between processes
7. `07_advanced_techniques.py` - Advanced patterns and best practices
8. `08_real_world_example.py` - A practical application example

## How to Use This Tutorial

1. Start with file 01 and work your way through numerically
2. Each file can be run directly: `python 01_process_basics.py`
3. Read the comments thoroughly - they explain key concepts
4. Try modifying the examples to deepen your understanding

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external packages needed (we use the standard library)

Happy parallel processing!
